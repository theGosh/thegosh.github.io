As a graduate teaching assistant, and an instructor of record, I have taught courses ranging from Human Biology to Field Ecology to Environmental Science.
 
My interest in teaching and my approach as an instructor grew out of my experiences as a student and a researcher. I work hard to present science as relevant; and instill in my students a habit of life-long learning.
 
To make my instruction useful to individuals with diverse learning styles, I employ a variety of techniques such as flipped classroom assignments or multimedia tools.Ultimately, by helping my students understand and convey basic biological principles, I want to bolster their engagement with science-related topics, as individuals, professionals and citizens.
 
My approach to teaching will keep changing as I continue to gain experience, but I will always strive for a classroom where students feel comfortable making mistakes, discussing challenging questions, and ultimately a classroom where they realize their ambitions. 
 
My interest: teaching bridge between human and animal biology; imagining how we can make things better for the natural world (it has to start with imagining); help people tapinto resources that open research for many  (open access data repositories).
