I am a behavioral ecologist and a science educator.

As a scientist, I study how animals navigate human-altered ecosystems. My goal is to use this knowledge for greater inclusion of wildlife’s resource needs as a factor in conservation and management decisions. 

As an educator, I strive to teach science as a discipline that is accessible and relevant to everyday life. In the classroom, my goals are to spark curiosity and encourage my students towards life-long learning.
