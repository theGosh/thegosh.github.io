I have extensive experience as a field biologist and a researcher working with a range of taxa, from insects, to birds to mammals, on topics as diverse as behavioral ecology or and biocontrol. 

My recent focus has been on the behavioral ecology of African savanna elephants, particularly in Southern Africa—a versatile model of an endangered keystone species; a nuisance impacting human welfare; and an economic asset. Its conservation and management are increasingly important [(Poulsen et al. 2018; Sandhage-Hofmann et al. 2021)](https://paperpile.com/c/xGuVEV/iQEM+d14T).

During my Master’s degree research with Dr. Bruce Schulte, I studied the social behavior of female savanna elephants in Addo Elephant National Park (AENP), South Africa. Based on traditional behavioral sampling, I related age, reproductive status and sex of nursing claves among adult females to their diurnal activities; and the degree of agonism and affiliation towards conspecifics. Females nursing female calves had spent more time foraging than their conspecific nursing male calves; the latter had spent more time nursing their calves and resting. In other polygynous species rearing of male offspring is linked to increased resource intake by the mother. Given lifelong, matrilineal interactions, female elephants may invest differently but equivalently in male and female calves [(Wisniewska et al. 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/xGuVEV/2VPd). For this work, I received Alltech Young Scientist’s 3rd Place Graduate Award 2011.
