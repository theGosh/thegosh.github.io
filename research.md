title: Research

I have extensive fieldwork experience and have done research on a range of taxa and topics, from invasive insects biocontrol, to nesting behavior in birds, to movement ecology in mammals.

My recent focus has been on the behavioral ecology of African savanna elephants, particularly in Southern Africa—a versatile model of an endangered keystone species; a nuisance impacting human welfare; and an economic asset. Its conservation and management are increasingly important.

During my **MS research**, I studied the social behavior of female savanna elephants in Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) in South Africa. Based on behavioral sampling, I related age, reproductive status and sex of nursing claves among adult females to their 1) diurnal activities; and 2) the degree of agonism/affiliation towards conspecifics. Females nursing female calves had spent more time foraging than females with male calves; the latter had nursed their calves and rested more. In other polygynous species, rearing males is linked to increased resource intake by the mothers. In matrilineal elephant herds, females may invest differently but equivalently in male and female calves (Wiśniewska et al. 2015; Alltech Young Scientist’s 3rd Place Graduate Award 2011).

While at AENP and later as a research fellow working on elephant behavior projects in Etosha NP in Namibia, I had frequently interacted with local scientists and community members. Their views on wildlife management inspired me to study elephant behavior through the lens of spatial ecology—as a tool in conservation.

In my **dissertation**, I developed two tools to test hypotheses about 1) how poaching-induced disturbance of social dynamics in virtual savanna elephant populations relates to group performance and 2) how free-ranging elephants integrate sociophysical information in their movement. 

First, I developed a social network simulator and characterized the effect of exploitation on social network architecture by virtually ‘poaching’ either the oldest, most 'socially central' or random individuals. Targeted ‘poaching’ of social hubs, regardless of their age, decreased network connectivity and the quality of social diffusion, suggesting that age does not always determine who acts as a 'social broker' (Wiśniewska et al. 2022). This, in turn, may be an example of an evolutionary buffer against destabilizing events, such as disease-induced die-offs or predation. It is possible to modify this simulator to test the impact of anthropogenic disturbance in othespellingr species with limited, real-world data (e.g., lethal management of wild swine).

Secondly, I modified an established resource selection function (RSF) to simultaneously test for the effects of the physical and social landscapes on individual movement. I applied the modified, social RSF (SRSF) to movement data from 1) a simulated swarm of 10 individuals; 2) a herd of 16 domestic goats; and 3) five, free ranging male elephants. Besides recovering expected physical preferences in all dataset (e.g., goats are attracted to vegetation), the SRSF estimates consistently recover social dynamics seen among observed elephants. Below, I exemplify movement of two tracked males. Guess which is has been observed to be more dominant.

Two Manuscripts detailing building and testing of the SRSF will soon be submitted for publication, so please stay tuned!

I would like to expand my focus to questions about interactions between wildlife and humans—a dynamic that remains problematic and poorly understood. The SRSF model will be handy, because it can (theoretically) estimate multiple sociophysical drivers of movement by any species, including humans.
