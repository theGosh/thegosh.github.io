I have extensive experience as a field biologist and a researcher working with a range of taxa, from insects, to birds to mammals, on topics as diverse as behavioral ecology or and biocontrol. 

My recent focus has been on the behavioral ecology of African savanna elephants, particularly in Southern Africa—a versatile model of an endangered keystone species; a nuisance impacting human welfare; and an economic asset. Its conservation and management are increasingly important.

During my MS research, I studied the social behavior of female savanna elephants in Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) in South Africa. Based on behavioral sampling, I related age, reproductive status and sex of nursing claves among adult females to their 1) diurnal activities; and 2) the degree of agonism/affiliation towards conspecifics. Females nursing female calves had spent more time foraging than females with male calves; the latter had nursed their calves and rested more. In other polygynous species, rearing males is linked to increased resource intake by the mothers. In matrilineal elephant herds, females may invest differently but equivalently in male and female calves (Wiśniewska et al. 2015; Alltech Young Scientist’s 3rd Place Graduate Award 2011).

While at AENP, and later as a research fellow working on another elephant behavior project in Etosha NP, Namibia, with Dr. Caitlin O’Connell, I had frequently interacted with local scientists, practitioners and community members. Their views on wildlife conservation and management inspired me to study animal behavior through the lens of spatial ecology, as a method for conservation.

In my dissertation, I developed two tools to test hypotheses about 1) how poaching-induced disturbance of social dynamics in virtual savanna elephant populations relates to group performance and 2) how free-ranging elephants integrate sociophysical information in their movement. 
  First, thanks to the Chateaubriand Fellowship, I spent a semester at the Hubert Curien Pluridisciplinary Institute, working with Drs. Cédric Sueur and Ivan Puga-Gonzales. We developed a social network simulator and characterized the effect of exploitation on social network architecture by virtually ‘poaching’ either the oldest or the most socially central individuals (as presumed social ‘brokers’); or random individuals. As expected, targeted ‘poaching’ of socially central elephants (regardless of age) decreased network connectivity and the quality of social diffusion (Figure 1), suggesting that elders (more experienced but less sociable) are equivalent social intermediaries as their gregarious, immature conspecifics (Wiśniewska et al. 2022). This may be an evolutionary buffer against destabilizing events, such as disease-induced die-offs or predation.
  As a tool, this simulator can be modified for testing the impact of anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., lethal management in wild or captive populations) in a variety of group-living species with limited, real-world data.
  Secondly, I also modified an established resource selection function (RSF) to simultaneously test for the effects of the physical and social landscapes on individual movement. I applied the modified model, or a social RSF (SRSF) to group movement data from 1) a simulated swarm of 10 individuals; 2) a herd of 16 domestic goats; and 3) five, free ranging male elephants. Besides recovering expected physical preferences in all dataset (e.g., goats are attracted to vegetation), the SRSF model estimates consistently recover social dynamics seen among observed elephants. In Figure 3, I exemplify movement of two tracked males and several features of the associated physical landscape. 
  Manuscripts detailing building and testing of the SRSF model will soon be submitted as research manuscripts, so stay tuned! 

I would like to expand my focus to questions about interactions between wildlife and humans—a dynamic that is increasingly problematic but poorly understood. I will need to learn new sampling and analytical techniques to evaluate human social behavior, but my research skills (many of them transferable) will be useful in carrying out interdisciplinary work. In fact, the SRSF model—a now tested estimator of (in theory) any number of social and physical drivers of movement—can help me set in motion my research ideas. Other topics that interest me, besides of course conservation behavior, include road ecology, wildlife criminology and environmental education.
